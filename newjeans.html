			      <li>NewJeans is a South Korean girl group formed by ADOR.</li>
				  <li>The group is composed of five members: Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein. </li>
				  <li>NewJeans rose to prominence upon their debut in 2022 with their girl next door image and "easy listening" pop and RnB songs inspired by the music of the 1990s.</li>
				  <li>The group's name, NewJeans, is a double entendre. It alludes to the idea that jeans are a timeless fashion item and the group's intention to carve a timeless image for themselves</li>
